# 1.1.2 through 1.1.6
August, 2023

Working to automate the deployment of this application to NuGet.
This is trickier than I expected.
* All files need to go in the `tools/` folder rather than the `lib/` folder.
* Add a `<packageTypes><packageType name="DotnetTool" /></packageTypes>` section to the NuSpec file.
* Add a `DotNetToolSettings.xml` file to the tools folder. 
* The file must be named `DotnetToolSettings.xml` exactly; any capitalization differences cause it to fail.

* Convert all enums to constants and add reference documentation.
